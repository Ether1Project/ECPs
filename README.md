This repo will hold all Ether-1 Community Proposals going forward.

#### ECP flow.

1. Create an issue in this repository - it will automatically be assigned an issue number.
2. The ECP is added to the table below.
3. Discussion is held around ECP. 
4. If the ECP is approved it will be marked as approved as well as carried out/executed, if changes are requested OP will need to the original ECP with requested changes. If the ECP is denied, the issue will be closed and locked.

IF an approved ECP requires code - the PR/Commit should reference the ECP issue in the commit message.
