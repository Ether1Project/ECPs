This repo will hold all offical Ether-1 Community Proposals (ECPs) going forward.

---

#### ECP Workflow

1. Create an issue in this repository - it will be assigned the next available issue number.
2. The ECP is added to the table below by the submitter using the established format.
3. Discussion is held around ECP as indicated within the ECP
5. If the ECP is approved, it will be marked as approved as well as carried out/executed; if changes are requested OP will need to modify the original ECP with requested changes. If the ECP is denied, the issue will be closed and locked. 

*If an approved ECP requires code - the PR/Commit should reference the ECP issue in the commit message.*

**All ECPs requiring funding will have the tx numbers listed in the ECP for accountability purposes.**
