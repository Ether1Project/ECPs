## Roles and Hierarchy
* Council is first
* Team Leader - Not all powerful - Must have council approval to hire and fire - simple in chat vote is all that is needed. Team Leader is fully responsible for role assignments for each team member and is free to move members around as needed. Assigns team members, pay, and reports directly to the council – Major changes to discord shall be voted on within the council no ECP needed – This role has equal power as the discord server admin.
* Community Manager – These are senior moderators able to make vast and sweeping changes to discord, must be approved by the Team Leader.
* Community Developers – Members with this role develop for Ether-1 community and can be core developers as well.
* Social media managers - In charge of representing a company across social channels as the sole voice of the brand. They respond to comments, compile campaigns and create content. These experts provide organizations with the guidance needed to enhance their online presence.
* Management Roles - These roles have specific skill sets needed in the areas assigned.
* Moderator - Moderators can do basic things like edit/delete messages, ban/kick people who violate any rules put in place, and make sure the Discord is a safe, healthy environment to do whatever is happening in the server.

## Marketing
This team does not solely produce marketing on its own, marketing should be a separate team all together. However, for content such as Tweet’s, posts, and articles should be at the discretion of the Team and its Leadership. As well as any maintenance needed should not need council approval or any approval – If you know something is broken and you can fix it, then you should.

Any new accounts will be approved by Social Media Managers and they will have access to all social media accounts. Social Media Managers also have the responsibility of adding moderators such as for Reddit or BCT Forum. As well as any forums we may have that deal with Ether-1. These moderators will be volunteer only and not considered staff or team members. Further, Council and Core Dev's still determine who has access to what accounts other than Social Media Managers at the discretion of those accounts Administrators. This does not change in my vision until the Permanent Council is elected. Or, if an ECP is passed in the future.

Further- I would request your active participation within the community. If you can not or are unwilling to be active in Ether-1 please do not waste my time by being a part of this team or its funds.

Finally, members who do not receive payment from this team are sponsored by another team and have chosen to be a part of this team. Example, Fallen as he is a member of etho.black team.
