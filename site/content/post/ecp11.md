Details:
This is the first project for ETHOLabs and will act as the foundation for most projects going forward. The idea is to create a one-stop shop for Ether-1 dApps / services for the community using a single portal. This portal will be built in such a way that it is mobile friendly and can be entirely hosted on ethoFS. Future dApps / Service that are built for Ether-1 would be added to the portal making it a hub for Ether-1 activity.

Below are the main services that will be offered as part of these ECP:
	- Encrypted chat system
	- ethoFS Hosting

The tasks/phases of these project would be:
	- Create a portal that is mobile friendly and can be entirely hosted on ethoFS
	- Portal to use MetaMask as authinatcation 
	- Create an encrypted chat system that allows messages to be sent to other ETHO members
		- Ability to create an address book
		- Group messaging
	- Integrate ethoFS hosting within the portal
	- Add other authinatcation methods such as Ledger / Trezor

During development, all progress will be posted on the etholabs.org website with links to demo's/beta's as it progresses through development. The timeline for creating the portal should take about 4 months depending on how many developers are working on it at any given time.

This project will not require any more funding as it is with in ETHOLabs current operating budget.
