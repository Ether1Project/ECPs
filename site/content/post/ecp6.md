Details:

I propose we rework EthoLab's to help build a team of Ether-1 developers to work on dApps / services for Ether-1. The new EthoLabs would be comprised of a management team of 3 or 5 people that would manage the development team and prioritize what is being worked on. All dApps / services would be first approved by ther Provisional Council then passed off to EthoLab's to manage. 

To help entice new developers as well as cover other costs EthoLabs would have a monthly budget of 25000 ETHO which will be managed by the EthoLab management to pay for developers, domains, hosting, etc. 

Action Items After Approved:
- Provisional Council creates new EthoLabs Management Team (Dissolve Old One)
- EthoLabs Management Setup new Multisig Wallet
- Move Old EthoLabs Funds to new Multisig
- Move First Monthly Payment to EthoLabs
