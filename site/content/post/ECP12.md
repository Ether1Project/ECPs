Details:
As we are well aware apple was extremely strict on our review due to us using open-source code which is already present on the app store, this result in hours and hundreds of dollars being thrown away, our android platform and iOS platfrom have a huge disconenct from a Visual and functionality platform.
For these reasons I'm proposing that we fund development of a mobile wallet which is cross platform - this would be written in VueJS & use Cordova/Capacitor to be run on iOS & Android. Such a task is better outsource, I already have a developer in mind for this project. He's done work for etho.black before,
He's extremely reliable as well. We also lack a Desktop Light wallet, whilst I've done the UI and built the main functionality inside of our VueJS light wallet, I lack the knowledge to build our the cross platfrom and major backend functionality, the same developer will be able to handle this.

The 2 Main Parts to this are: 
	- Mobile Wallets (40 Days) - $450 (USD) - this cannot be paid in ETHO.
	- Desktop light Wallet (40 Days) - $300 (USD) - this cannot be paid in ETHO.

The features of said wallets:
	- Unlock with Face or Finger ID or Passcode,
  - Send coins,
  - Confirm Sending coins with Face or Finger ID or Passcode
  - Recieve coins (Display address & Address QR Code)
  - Show Last 20 transactions,
  - Support for multiple addresses stored securely on the device,
  - Display the Value of the users Coins in multiple different currencies available,
  - Display each Transaction details,
  - Light & Dark Mode

During development, all progress will be posted to the regular #dev-activity channel as well as screenshots/videos when applicable. 

This will require $750 in funding, it will need to be payed in USD, as for how to secure that funding, I'd like to ask the council if they could provide options.
